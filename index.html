<h3>1/ Danny<br>Grade; 12<br>Overview; Teachers KO Tarif<br>Blog; Just wanted to thank our teachers, like explaining all the things. Mr Ajay Jha from the chemistry faculty, he teaches so well that everyone understands the key concept of the chapters. Meanwhile, how can we forget, Mr Abhay Mishra from the Zoology faculty, he teaches exceptionally superficially, that everybody learns and have keen interest in understanding the topic like heart, kidney, brain,etc. Like, salute to him, his way of teaching are just like his notes ie finishing in 2-3 page. How can we not forget the management of our college. Let just leave it for a while, we will talk more thing about our college in the next blog.<br></h3><hr>
